In this Lightning Talk we'll cover:

- documenting arrays of arrays
- refactoring to data objects
- limitation on typehints for arrays of data objects
- using named properties in functions
- using the spread operator over associative arrays in named properties

If you're interested in checking the interesting bits, look over the `tests` folder.
