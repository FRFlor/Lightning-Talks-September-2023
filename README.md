## Lightning Talks: September 2023

### Friendly Intellisense with PHP

In this Lightning Talk we'll cover:

- using array{<elements>} notation to document associative arrays
- documenting arrays of arrays
- refactoring to data objects
- limitation on typehints for arrays of data objects
- using named properties in functions
- using the spread operator over associative arrays in named properties

### Are you looking over this code by yourself?

live-demonstration.

If you're interested in checking the interesting bits, look over the `tests` folder.
